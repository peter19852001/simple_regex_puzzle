# simple_regex_puzzle
To archive my old for solving a regex puzzle in a naive way.

The regex puzzle is to fill in a hexagonal grid with characters such that the regex at the rows and diagonals are all satisfied.
The original website of the puzzle is inaccessible now, but someone made a page for it at https://rampion.github.io/RegHex/

My code uses a naive DFS and simple constraint propagation, and was written years ago, so does not necessarily represent good coding style of best practices, but just for fun.
